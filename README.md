## Feature Requirements

We want to have toasts show up whenever we receive a message from the server that a new client just
signed up! It should look like something like:

![Image of Prototype](prototype.png)

It doesn't have to look exact.

### Requirements

* When you click "New Submission" your app must respond and show a toast
* Toasts that are "liked" are added to the list on the page
* Toasts that are dismissed are removed and you never see them again
* When you refresh the browser, the list must persist.
* (Bonus) Any level of polish you think would make for a good UX

### Hints

* Focus on getting the core requirements down first. Then work on polish if you have time
* If you use MUI, they have a `<Snackbar>` component that can be helpful.

## Submitting

Please submit your code, with commit messages, to a public git repository and reply to
the recruiting emails with the link to your repository.
